            "The image represents a moment captured in time and offers its beauty again and again. 
            In my photographs I attempt to share the world through my eyes and capture its everyday beauty for all to see."

         <p>
            Raised in Washington, in a small town of roughly 500; I was outdoors a lot. Form a young age I developed a fondness for natural beauty and art. 
            In 2015 I began tinkering around with CG art and quickly began to pursue one of the hardest subjects in this field, nature. 
            This hobby began to grow over the next couple of years until finally I got fed up with unrealistic results and moved up to photography, 
            but my cheap camera phone could only do so much.  In 2017 I bought my first cheap camera drone and was amazed at the new angels and potential that opened up. 
            A short time later I made the investment and bought a lightly used DJI Phantom 3 Pro. This where the hobby truly took off.

            Today I shoot with a Sony NEX-5N with a 16-50mm lens, a oneplus 2 phone for wide angle shots and field editing, 
            and my Phantom 3 for aerial photography. If you are intrested in my work check out my Instagram portfolio at: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/z8_labs/"> @Z8_labs</a>
